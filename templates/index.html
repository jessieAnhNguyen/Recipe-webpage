        Vermicelli Noodles with Grilled Pork, or Bun Cha, is a very popular and
        delicious Vietnamese dish. Bun Cha is round rice noodles served in a
        bowl of dipping sauce with grilled pork, pickles, and greens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although originally a street food specialty, Bun Cha is also a popular
        homemade dish. This recipe is all you need to create the mouth-watering
        grilled pork patties and pork belly. Along with them are pearly white
        rice vermicelli, a basket with all sorts of greens, a bowl of dipping
        sauce with some sliced pickled carrots and green papaya, and of course,
        those beautifully charred pork pieces.

            is an essential condiment in Vietnamese cuisine, and usually
            consists of fish sauce, sugar, lime juice/lemon juice/rice vinegar,
            water and minced garlic and chilli to taste. My preferred ratio is 1

      <h3>Instructions</h3>

      <ol id="stepList">
        <li>
          Picking the Cut, Marinating and Grilling the Meat:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Choose a fatty cut of pork, either pork belly or pork shoulder, to
              prevent the meat from drying while being grilled. I prefer pork
              shoulder because it is relatively leaner than pork belly, and the
              melted pork shoulder fat has a crunchy texture and savoury buttery
              flavour, which is rather fun to devour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vietnamese caramel sauce is NOT like the sweet caramel sauce
              served with desserts, but is rather used as a food colouring to
              give the meat in savoury dishes a golden brown colour. It is
              really easy to make: simply boil sugar and water together.
              However, you can substitute Vietnamese caramel sauce with golden
              syrup or honey, or even the homemade golden syrup leftover from
              making mooncakes! The sugar content in all of the above will
              caramelise while you grill the meat, giving the pork not only a
              scrumptious chargrilled colour but also a smoky sweet caramel-like
              flavour.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pork is best grilled over charcoal fire, charcoal grilled pork
              has a far superior smoky flavour to oven grilled one. If you are
              using the oven, put the meat over a wired rack or a pizza pan,
              surfaces that allow the meat itself to be exposed to the heat from
              the top and the bottom. This will prevent the pork from being too
              dry, the grilled meat will be more tender as the heat is
              distributed evenly throughout.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>
          Making the pickles
          <ul>
            <li>
              Vietnamese cuisine is known as one of the healthiest in the world.
              Almost all Vietnamese dishes have vegetables, especially meaty and
              fatty dishes, to balance out the flavours, textures as well as the
              nutrients. You will easily find pickles and an abundant amount of
              fresh herbs and vegetables being served with many Vietnamese
              traditional dishes, and they usually come free with your meal in
              the restaurant by the way.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pickles in Bun Cha (and many other dishes such as crispy
              Vietnamese pancakes) are usually made of thinly sliced green
              papayas and carrots. Cucumbers or kohlrabies are also great
              substitute for green papayas, and the contrast between the green
              and the bright orange colour of the pickles makes your dish more
              eye-catching and appealing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pickles are also made fresh rather than preserved for a long time.
              When you make the fresh pickles, it is important to add sugar
              first rather than salt, as it will help the pickles be more
              crunchy. Adding salt will immediately draw out the moisture from
              the vegetables and make them a bit tough to chew.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Boiling the Rice Vermicelli:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you have fresh rice vermicelli, perfect. You just need to poach
              it through hot water just before serving, so that the rice
              vermicelli will soften and soak up the dipping sauce better.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you do not live in Vietnam or near a big Asian market, it is
              more likely that you will end up with dried rice vermicelli.
              Although some packages say that the noodles can be soaked in hot
              water before serving, I find that the noodles do not expand
              properly even after being soaked for a long time, and thus would
              prefer to boil them in a pot of hot water. You can also poach the
              noodles through hot water again just before serving.
            </li>

        </li>

        <li>
          Making the dipping sauce:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The salt content of fish sauce varies from different types, so
              there is no fixed ratio to make the dipping sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              What I would recommend is to mix sugar, lemon juice and water
              together first, taste it to make sure you are happy with the lemon
              juice. Then, gradually add fish sauce to taste. Tasting as you go
              along rather than dumping all the ingredients in at once will help
              you identify easily which flavour component (sweet, sour,
              savoury,...) is lacking.
            </li>
            <li>
              When added into it, the garlic (and chilli) should float on the
              surface, it looks more visually appealing rather than chunks of
              garlics sinking at the bottom.
            </li>
          </ul>

# food-website

A simple single-page website on a Vietnamese food recipe

The website is created by me as I started to learn Web development. The tech stack I use:

- Back-end: Flask, Jinja2, SQLite
- Front-end: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery

You can find the web app deployed at http://anguy39.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment09/

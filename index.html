    <h2>What is Bun Cha?</h2>
    <p>
      Vermicelli Noodles with Grilled Pork, or Bun Cha, is a very popular and
      delicious Vietnamese dish. Bun Cha is round rice noodles served in a bowl
      of dipping sauce with grilled pork, pickles, and greens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although originally a street food specialty, Bun Cha is also a popular
      homemade dish. This recipe is all you need to create the mouth-watering
      grilled pork patties and pork belly. Along with them are pearly white rice
      vermicelli, a basket with all sorts of greens, a bowl of dipping sauce
      with some sliced pickled carrots and green papaya, and of course, those
      beautifully charred pork pieces.

        Dipping sauce and Noodles

          <a href="http://www.ricenflour.com/glossary/dipping-sauce/"
            >Dipping sauce</a
          >
          is an essential condiment in Vietnamese cuisine, and usually consists
          of fish sauce, sugar, lime juice/lemon juice/rice vinegar, water and
          minced garlic and chilli to taste. My preferred ratio is 1 sugar : 2/3
          acid : 1 fish sauce : 7 water.

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol id="stepList">
      <li>
        Picking the Cut, Marinating and Grilling the Meat:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose a fatty cut of pork, either pork belly or pork shoulder, to
            prevent the meat from drying while being grilled. I prefer pork
            shoulder because it is relatively leaner than pork belly, and the
            melted pork shoulder fat has a crunchy texture and savoury buttery
            flavour, which is rather fun to devour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vietnamese caramel sauce is NOT like the sweet caramel sauce served
            with desserts, but is rather used as a food colouring to give the
            meat in savoury dishes a golden brown colour. It is really easy to
            make: simply boil sugar and water together. However, you can
            substitute Vietnamese caramel sauce with golden syrup or honey, or
            even the homemade golden syrup leftover from making mooncakes! The
            sugar content in all of the above will caramelise while you grill
            the meat, giving the pork not only a scrumptious chargrilled colour
            but also a smoky sweet caramel-like flavour.
          </li>
          <li>
            The pork is best grilled over charcoal fire, charcoal grilled pork
            has a far superior smoky flavour to oven grilled one. If you are
            using the oven, put the meat over a wired rack or a pizza pan,
            surfaces that allow the meat itself to be exposed to the heat from
            the top and the bottom. This will prevent the pork from being too
            dry, the grilled meat will be more tender as the heat is distributed
            evenly throughout.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <li>
        Making the pickles
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vietnamese cuisine is known as one of the healthiest in the world.
            Almost all Vietnamese dishes have vegetables, especially meaty and
            fatty dishes, to balance out the flavours, textures as well as the
            nutrients. You will easily find pickles and an abundant amount of
            fresh herbs and vegetables being served with many Vietnamese
            traditional dishes, and they usually come free with your meal in the
            restaurant by the way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pickles in Bun Cha (and many other dishes such as crispy Vietnamese
            pancakes) are usually made of thinly sliced green papayas and
            carrots. Cucumbers or kohlrabies are also great substitute for green
            papayas, and the contrast between the green and the bright orange
            colour of the pickles makes your dish more eye-catching and
            appealing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pickles are also made fresh rather than preserved for a long time.
            When you make the fresh pickles, it is important to add sugar first
            rather than salt, as it will help the pickles be more crunchy.
            Adding salt will immediately draw out the moisture from the
            vegetables and make them a bit tough to chew.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Boiling the Rice Vermicelli:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have fresh rice vermicelli, perfect. You just need to poach
            it through hot water just before serving, so that the rice
            vermicelli will soften and soak up the dipping sauce better.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not live in Vietnam or near a big Asian market, it is more
            likely that you will end up with dried rice vermicelli. Although
            some packages say that the noodles can be soaked in hot water before
            serving, I find that the noodles do not expand properly even after
            being soaked for a long time, and thus would prefer to boil them in
            a pot of hot water. You can also poach the noodles through hot water
            again just before serving.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </li>

      <li>
        Making the dipping sauce:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The salt content of fish sauce varies from different types, so there
            is no fixed ratio to make the dipping sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            What I would recommend is to mix sugar, lemon juice and water
            together first, taste it to make sure you are happy with the lemon
            juice. Then, gradually add fish sauce to taste. Tasting as you go
            along rather than dumping all the ingredients in at once will help
            you identify easily which flavour component (sweet, sour,
            savoury,...) is lacking.
          </li>
          <li>
            When added into it, the garlic (and chilli) should float on the
            surface, it looks more visually appealing rather than chunks of
            garlics sinking at the bottom.
          </li>
